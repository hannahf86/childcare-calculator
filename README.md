## Overview

### The Brief

My childminder once described to me the maths she has to do in order to produce a childcare invoice. I was suprised the council didn't have a calculator to make this easy for their employees, so I decided to make one.

Upon completion, users should be able to:

- Calculate their weekly invoice amount for childcare costs
- Implement the correct funding rates where possible
- Receive a monetary value for the week

## My process

My goal was to improve my skills with React Hooks and Typescript, so I did not spend a lot of time on the UI until the end.

I first worked out the maths involved and then experimented with a few different methods to gather and display the information in the web app.

I settled on the useEffect, useState and else if methods as I found that this was the cleanest way to deal with the numbers and options the user had.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

The goal of this project, from a developer's perspective, was to improve my use of common React Hooks and Typescript, which I now feel more confident in using.

### Continued development

Further development will include the following facilities and features...
- User authentication
- Ability to add multiple children
- Ability to store family information using databases
- The facility to print invoices
